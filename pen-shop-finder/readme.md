# Pen Shop Finder

Vue Demo where a fountain pen fan can view online pen shops as well as add to the listing their own recommendations.

## Description

Often, it's difficult to find a decent penshop online. Dropping links in Facebook groups often get lost in the thread. Now there's a permanent hub of links users can add to. This project is a demo at the moment.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Currently running just Vue

### Installing

- Clone repo and run "npm i" in the terminal
